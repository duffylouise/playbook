## Sustainability

We at dxw are working towards becoming a more environmentally sustainable
company. We are focusing on three main areas to reduce our impact:

### Our Offices

In our offices we recycle waste where possible and are in the process of
switching to environmentally friendly office supplies & refreshments. We are
also in the process of changing to renewable energy suppliers.

### Our Products

We are aware that digital services have a significant environmental impact. We
are finding ways to reduce our contribution to that. This will involve hosting
where possible with renewable energy and building our products efficiently.

### Our Behaviours

Whenever possible we opt for rail travel. Due to client needs this isn’t always
possible but we’re investigating how offset our carbon footprint in future. We
often work remotely which reduces the need for travel. We’re exploring ways to
lower our own individual environmental impact.
